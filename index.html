				<h3>What is DropOFF?</h3>
				<hr>
                <p>Here at DropOFF, we provide real-time-saving solutions to businesses, students, and individuals. We’re not like any other startup where old ideas run rampant—at DropOFF, innovation is hardwired into our DNA.

				<h3>The P2PLP</h3>
				<hr>
                <p>Every student has encountered the problem where they have finally finished a paper or have just gotten done typing up a problem set, and then they are forced to waste your precious time waiting at the printer. Exhausting! Corporations face a similar problem, too. Employees must print things frequently for, say, deadlines.<br><br>
That right there is the core inefficiency that DropOFF targets. We call it the P2PLP&#8212the Printer 2 Paper Latency Problem. And not only do we have a name for it—we’ve solved it. By, in real time, constantly printing whatever you are working on and shredding the old copy, we at DropOFF ensure you get what you need—printed, and fast.

                <p>DropOFF works by using a technology that integrates with whatever document service you are using—be it Microsoft Word, Open Office, Google Docs, or something else—and sending any and every version of the document to our servers to be printed. Then, once you want a printed copy of your document, you just need to drive down to one of our conveniently located facilities to pick up a copy of your work. It will be there. Ready. And printed. <br><br>
One common question we get asked is, “Won’t it take a long time to transmit all that data across the Internet?” Here at DropOFF, our engineers have already tackled that common concern. By only sending the altered sections from your computer to our facilities, don’t need to transmit entire Microsoft Word or Google Docs documents. At DropOFF, we’re not just a printer or shredder company. We’re a problem company.

	    			A common question we get asked at DropOFF is, “What about privacy? How do I know the rough drafts of my essay are secure? Couldn’t some malicious actor go through your recycling and tape together bits of my work to plagiarize it?”
Your concern is ours too. Thus, we’ve engineered DropHOLE, where instead of printing into shredders, we print directly into black holes. Because no information can escape a black hole, your information is secure. Then, if you need to access it, we have a DropOFF pluck-ready employee floating by a printer, a printer that is being slowly pulled back from an ever-expanding event horizon via a complex system that amounts to, essentially, a tether.

That is why we had our research division looking into science, and it is there that they discovered the combustion reaction. It states that paper plus oxygen yields liquid water as well as some other things.
That’s why here at DropOFF, we offer not just an option to print paper directly into shredders, but to print paper directly into burning garbage cans. The paper will then “combust” and turn into water. This water feeds the four P’s: people, pets, plants, and our planet. So at DropOFF, you can either be Green—or you can be Blue. <br><br><img src="assets/img/combustion.png" style="width:50%; float:right;">

				<hr>
                <p>When DropOFF began, it was a simple company. Just printers, paper, and shredders. But as the company expanded, so did our interests. In fact, we got interested in every letter of the alphabet—a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, and y—just to name a few. While not all these letters spurred companies of their own, many did, and so we decided to house them under an umbrella company, so they don’t get wet.

Wikipedia defines an LLC as “a company that has limited liability, i.e., a company whose owners can get in trouble for a limited number of things.” But then we realized, wouldn’t DropABET be so much better if it were not liable for anything at all? That’s why DropABET is the first NLC—a No Liability Company.</p>

	    			Who even has time for watching television live these days? That’s why we at DropOFF created a service that will let you stream TV directly to your printer. Our innovative design makes use of the fact that television is broadcast in still images (these images are called “frames” by business insiders). Once we realized that each of these “frames” has exactly the same size, shape, and motion-consistency as paper, it was only a small jump before we set up a service to steams TV shows page-at-a-time directly to your personal printer, giving you TV at the push of a button.

	    			What began as an offshoot of DropKICKSTARTER soon blossomed into one of our most powerful tools for both social and economic optimization. While DropCHILD began with a simple premise—a decentralized daycare and babysitting system—it became so much more.
Inspired by laissez-faire economics, DropCHILD (internally dubbed Lazy Fairy Economics) optimizes the current daycare and babysitting model by making childcare a commodity. Thus, if you intrust a babysitter to take care of your child, that caretaker will have the option of hiring their own caretaker for the child—at a lower cost. Being able to do this, the market becomes more efficent as it is able adjust to the constantly shifting conditions or the real world.
Kids enjoy hanging out with other kids, which means they’ll be comfortable with being bundeled. And to them, life is mostly a game, so they’re already prepared for entering world of finance. Whithout getting into too much technical detail, this allows for the construction of complex financial derivatives involving your kids. Parents may even enjoy hedging their bets and reducing the volitility of the assests by betting appropriately against the saftey of their children.

As a special interest group, DropGRICULTURE recognizes that it needs to protect its interests. We also wish to support our sister companies, such as DropKICKSTARTER. We are also part of a social movement for re-introducing people previously convicted of heinous crimes back into the work force. That is why DropGRICULTURE has invested in an unorthodox team of highly effective lobbyists to pressure the Unites States Congress into sustaining—and even growing—this cycle.

However, there is plenty of 3D content available, for free, in the real world. And with that realization, eyeDROP came to be. Our product, eyeDROP, is a VR system that works using a dual camera-projector system worn by the user, in their eyes. First, the camera component scans the outside word, turning what it sees into data. Then, the data is sent to the projection system—a set of micro-laser contact lenses pointed at the user’s retina. The lasers project the real world directly into your eyes with only a slight delay!

                    Like many stories, the story of DropOFF has a beginning, a middle, and an end. I, Tommy Schneider, CEO of DropOFF, will take you on that journey.<br><br>
The beginning. It all began in the titular halls of Harvey Mudd College, where I met a young and bright Evan Hubinger. (It should be noted here that Evan has submitted a special request that he be played only by Andrew Garfield should <i>DropOFF: The Idea, The Idea, The Idea, and the Idea Behind the Idea</i> ever be adapted into a movie.) It was only minutes after Evan and I met that Evan said, “We should build a company together,” and it was only seconds later that I said, “I accept!”<br><br>
Next came Jonah. A young and bright Jonah Rubin caught my attention one day when he stumbled into a meeting between Evan and me. After stunning us with a brilliant pitch for the company’s visual lexicon, Jonah made his biggest contribution to the company. Right before leaving the room, he turned around and told us, “Drop the ‘Drop’. It’s cleaner that way.” Things have never been quite the same since.<br><br>
The middle. Soon after founding the company, CEO Thomas Schneider dropped out of Harvey Mudd College over winter break, where he spent his time writing text for the DropOFF website. He worked very hard, and even wrote a pretty good story, with killer style and great structure and some really cool and impressive vocab words and a hearty-heaping of polysyndeton. His writing can still be seen today on the DropOFF website, even to this day.<br><br>
The end. Or is it?

                    At DropOFF, we have a unique corporate culture. Our motto is, “Paper<em>work</em> hard, paper<em>play</em> hard.” While we are only offering unpaid internships at the moment, we expect that the many benefits enjoyed by employees will more than compensate for a lack of pay. For example, we offer free practice coding software, or preforming corporate research in subjects such as chemistry or economics.<br><br>
	DropOFF adheres to a minimalist floorplan, and has a BYOO (Bring Your Own Office) policy. Moreover, employees with dietary restrictions will feel right at home at our cafeteria, which is empty and non-functioning. We also offer a limited number of free pens to employees with “Printing is the future!” displayed on them. Plus, our unique compensation strategy means all of your DropOff income is 100% tax-free!
